# Spanish_Parser
The final practice of the Programming Languages course at the EAFIT University consists of a simple sentence analyzer in Spanish (parser), in which the following functionalities can be observed:

1. Check if a phrase is valid or not
2. If it is valid, it indicates that it is valid in green
3. If it is invalid, it indicates that it is invalid in red.
4. A sentence cannot have more than 1 verb since it is a simple sentence
5. Supports articles, nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and links
6. It has an interactive menu
7. You can choose to parse another sentence or exit the program
8. Print the list of all the words available to build the sentence
9. It has 8 different types of simple sentence structures
10. If there is any word that is not in the previously defined list, this indicates that the word is not found and that you must re-enter a sentence with the available words
